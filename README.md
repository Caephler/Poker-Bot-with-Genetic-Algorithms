# Poker Bot 
This repository contains a Texas Hold'em bot trained using a genetic algorithm. The bot was built by [George Han](marble999) and myself as one part of our final project for [Math 153](https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/classes/math-153) (Evolutionary Dynamics) at Harvard University. The bot significantly outperforms our heuristic-based baseline bot and a random bot, but is *not* competitive with human poker players. 

Additional resources for poker-playing bots, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning may be found below:
